Nice progress so far! You've built a solid foundation. Here's what I'd suggest for your next steps:
Immediate next topics (in order):

Sliding Window - Natural extension of two pointers, super useful for substring/subarray problems
Hashing (HashMaps/HashSets) - Game-changer for optimizing many array problems from O(n²) to O(n)
Strings - Apply your array knowledge here, tons of overlap

Why this order?

These build directly on what you know
You'll start seeing how to optimize brute force solutions
Hashing especially will help you revisit and improve solutions to problems you've already solved

Practical approach:

Spend 1-2 weeks on sliding window (aim for 10-15 problems)
Then 1-2 weeks on hashing (another 10-15 problems)
Mix in string problems throughout

After that, move to:

Stacks & Queues
Linked Lists
Recursion & Backtracking

Tips:

Don't rush to new topics - depth > breadth early on
When stuck, try brute force first, then optimize
Revisit old problems using new techniques you learn

Which platform are you using besides LeetCode? And are you following any structured list (like Blind 75, NeetCode 150)?
