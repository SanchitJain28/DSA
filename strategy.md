# LeetCode Mastery Guide

## Topic-Wise Learning Path

### Suggested Order (Smart Approach)

1. **Arrays & Hashing** (2 weeks) - easiest entry point
2. **Two Pointers** (1 week) - builds on arrays
3. **Sliding Window** (1 week) - natural progression
4. **Stack** (1 week) - introduces new data structure
5. **Binary Search** (1 week) - crucial technique
6. **Linked Lists** (1 week)
7. **Trees** (2 weeks) - gets challenging
8. **Backtracking** (1-2 weeks)
9. **Dynamic Programming** (3-4 weeks) - hardest, save for later
10. **Graphs** (2 weeks)

## When to Look at Solutions

### The 20-30 Minute Rule

- **Struggle for 20-30 minutes MAX** - If you're completely stuck with no ideas, look at hints or solution approach (not full code)
- **If you have an idea** but can't implement it, keep trying for another 15 minutes
- **Don't waste 3 hours** on one problem - that's ego, not learning

### After Looking at Solution

1. Close it completely
2. Code it yourself from scratch
3. Come back to it 3-7 days later and solve again

## Daily Strategy

### Quality > Quantity

- **1-2 problems daily** is better than 5 problems once a week
- Start with **Easy problems** in each topic until comfortable
- Move to **Medium** when you're solving 70%+ of Easy problems

### The Pattern

1. Solve problem (with or without help)
2. Look at top 2-3 solutions even if you solved it
3. Note the pattern/technique in a document
4. Solve 3-4 similar problems using that pattern

## Tips to Not Fuck it up

### DON'T

- ❌ Compare yourself to people solving 500 problems
- ❌ Jump to Hard problems to look smart
- ❌ Memorize solutions - you'll bomb interviews
- ❌ Skip the "boring" fundamentals
- ❌ Give up after a bad week

### DO

- ✅ Talk through your approach out loud (interview practice)
- ✅ Time yourself loosely (not strict, but aware)
- ✅ Review problems you solved 1-2 weeks ago
- ✅ Join a study group or find an accountability buddy
- ✅ Accept that DP will kick your ass at first - everyone struggles

## When You're Stuck on Everything

If you're stuck on most Easy problems, your fundamentals need work:

- Review basic data structures (arrays, hashmaps, sets)
- Brush up on time/space complexity
- Do easier problems on HackerRank first

## Progress Milestones

- **First 50 problems:** Slow and painful
- **Problems 50-150:** Patterns start clicking
- **After 150-200:** You'll recognize most patterns
- **You don't need 500 problems** for most interviews

## Recommended Resources

- **Blind 75** - Curated list covering all essential patterns
- **NeetCode 150** - Expanded version with video explanations
- **LeetCode Patterns** - Focus on pattern recognition over volume

## Remember

The goal isn't to solve every problem - it's to recognize patterns fast. Once you've done 10 sliding window problems, the 11th is just a variation.

**Consistency beats intensity every time.**
