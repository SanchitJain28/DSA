// A palindrome string is basically a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case if needed).

// Example:

// "madam" → same forward and backward ✅

// "racecar" → still "racecar" when reversed ✅

// "noon" → yup ✅

// "hello" → nope ❌ (reversed = "olleh")

// It’s like the string is flexing in the mirror saying, “Yeah, I look the same both ways.”

// Want me to show you how to check if a string is a palindrome in JavaScript?
