Sequential Learning Path
✅ Completed

-> Arrays
-> Two Pointers
-> Hash Maps/Sets

📍 Do Next (In Order)
-> 4. Sliding Window

Fixed size windows
Variable size windows
Key: Max/min subarray problems

5. Stack

Basic stack operations
Monotonic stack (next greater/smaller element)
Valid parentheses patterns

6. String Manipulation

String building/reversal
Palindromes
Anagrams (uses hash maps)

7. Binary Search

On sorted arrays
On answer space (harder, but important)

8. Linked Lists

Reversal
Fast/slow pointers (cycle detection)
Merge operations

9. Recursion Basics

Base case + recursive case
Call stack understanding
Required for trees/graphs

10. Trees (Binary Trees)

Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)
DFS on trees
BFS on trees (level order)

11. Binary Search Trees

BST properties
Searching/insertion
Validation

12. Heaps/Priority Queue

Min heap, max heap
Top K problems
Merge K sorted lists

13. Graphs

Graph representation (adjacency list/matrix)
DFS on graphs
BFS on graphs
Cycle detection

14. Backtracking

Permutations/combinations
Subsets
N-Queens type problems

15. Dynamic Programming

1D DP (Fibonacci, climbing stairs)
2D DP (grid problems)
Knapsack patterns
(Start only after completing 1-14)

16. Advanced Topics (Later)

Tries
Union Find
Topological Sort
Advanced DP
